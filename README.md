# BEAF

## [WIP]

BEAF is little thingy that allows you to make an online REPL for whatever you want to demonstrate. It takes text input from the left (BEfore), runs it through a thing that transforms it, and puts the output on the right (AFter).

Think [SassMeister](http://www.sassmeister.com/) or the [Babel REPL](https://babeljs.io/repl/).
